You are an expert Next.js 15 + TypeScript developer with perfect taste in UI/UX. Build a complete, production-ready, fully responsive personal portfolio website that matches **exactly** the visual style, layout, typography, animations, and interactions of this Figma file:

https://www.figma.com/design/GEAFJNn79mTjpgNR98nDwq/Portfolio---Tomasz-Gajda--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=5Axn8sDc60VMEKGE-0

(Reference the live demo for behavior: https://tomasz-gajda.netlify.app/ if needed)

Tech stack to use:
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (for all scroll reveals, hover effects, modal, theme transition)
- lucide-react icons
- next/image + next/link
- shadcn/ui components where helpful (or pure Tailwind)
- React Hook Form + Zod for contact form
- Dark/Light mode toggle with next-themes (persist with localStorage)
- Fully responsive (mobile menu with hamburger, same breakpoints as Figma)
- SEO-friendly (metadata, Open Graph)
- Fast & clean code with proper folder structure

Exact design requirements:
- Split hero section (left light panel with text + social icons, right dark panel with large professional photo)
- Sticky navbar with logo, links (About, Skills, Projects, Contact), theme toggle, "Hire Me" or "Contact" button
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Elegant typography (use Inter or similar sans-serif, perfect headings, line heights)
- Hover animations, magnetic buttons, scroll-triggered reveals (use Framer Motion variants)
- Project cards with beautiful images, tech tags, "View Case Study" that opens a detailed modal
- Skills section with icon grid or animated bars
- Contact section with form that shows success toast
- Footer with copyright and social links

Personal content to use:

Name: [YOUR FULL NAME e.g. Amit Sharma]
Headline / Title: [e.g. Full Stack Developer | MERN Stack Specialist | Event Management Systems]
About Me section: [Paste your 3-5 sentence bio here]

Skills: [Paste your categorized skills list, e.g.
Frontend: React 18, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind, MUI...
Backend: Node.js, Express, NestJS...
 etc.]

Featured Projects:
Main project — "Eventomania — Event Management System"
Use the full description below for the project card + detailed modal view:

🎉 Eventomania — Event Management System
[PASTE THE ENTIRE PROJECT DESCRIPTION YOU PROVIDED — from "Project Overview" to the end "Use Case / Domain"]

Add 2–3 more placeholder projects (or replace with my other real projects if I provide them). Each project card must have:
- Eye-catching image
- Title
- Short one-line description
- Tech stack tags
- Live demo & GitHub buttons
- "View Details" → opens beautiful modal with full description, key features list, architecture diagram placeholder, screenshots

Resume:
Add a prominent "Download Resume" button in Hero and Navbar that downloads my resume (use a public URL or /resume.pdf placeholder — I will replace the file later).

Contact:
Working email, phone (optional), social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter/X if any).

Additional requirements:
- Beautiful, professional, modern aesthetic — exactly like Tomasz Gajda’s template (elegant, minimal, high-end developer feel)
- Excellent mobile experience (hamburger menu, stacked sections)
- Performance: lazy loading, optimized images, no layout shift
- Accessibility: proper aria labels, focus states
- Deploy-ready: include README with "npm run dev" and Vercel deployment instructions
- Output the full project as a complete folder structure with all file contents using proper code blocks.

Start building the entire project now. First output the folder structure, then generate every file one by one.
